### Hey there, fellow bio-enthusiast! ðŸ§¬ðŸ”¬

I'm a pathogen sequencing technician and research data analyst working in the [Shelby O'Connor lab at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.](https://slo.pathology.wisc.edu/) My role in client services keeps me at the forefront of cutting-edge research, offering a daily dose of excitement and innovation. 

With a solid foundation in the world of genomics, nurtured in the [Korf Lab at the University of California, Davis](https://github.com/KorfLab) and armed with a Bioinformatics degree, I am grepping and piping my way through large genomic datasets. 

My current research interests include:
- Unraveling the secrets of Viral Evolution
- Proofreading Genome annotation pipelines
- [Exploring Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/willgardnerbiotech/code)
- High Throughput Computing
- Metagenomic environmental virus sampling/sequencing

When I get tired of scratching my head while debugging I like to take a break by dawning my lab coat and transform plasma into FASTQ files.
